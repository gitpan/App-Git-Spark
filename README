DESCRIPTION
    Plot your git commit history on the commandline with sparklines. This is
    a mashup of git, spark <https://github.com/holman/spark>, and Perl.

COMPARING GRAPHS
    Unfortunately you often cannot compare `spark` output because the
    scaling is relative. For example these two data series produce identical
    graphs despite have very different data.

        ⚡ spark 1 2 3 4 5
        ▁▂▄▆█
        ⚡ spark 10 20 30 40 50
        ▁▂▄▆█

    To solve this, you must put a max and a min in front of the data to get
    consistent scaling. For example:

        ⚡ spark 50 1 1 2 3 4 5
        █▁▁▁▁▁▁
        ⚡ spark 50 1 10 20 30 40 50
        █▁▂▃▅▆█

    git-spark assumes the min is zero and users can pass in the max using
    the --scale option. (Note that git-spark chops off the max/min
    characters from the output so this is all hidden behind the scenes.)

INSTALLATION
    First, download spark and put it somewhere in your $PATH. (TODO: Include
    spark in this distro.)

    Next, install git-spark with cpanm. cpanm
    <https://metacpan.org/module/App::cpanminus> is the standard tool the
    Perl community uses to download and install Perl libraries from the CPAN
    <https://metacpan.org/>. The following should get you up and running
    quickly:

        curl -L http://cpanmin.us | perl - --sudo App::cpanminus
        cpanm App::Git::Spark
